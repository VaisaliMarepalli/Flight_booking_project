# ✈️ Flight Price Prediction

This project uses machine learning algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest to predict flight ticket prices.

## 📊 Features
- Data cleaning and EDA
- Model comparison and accuracy metrics
- Final model selection based on R2 Score

## 📁 Files
- `FLight_booking_project_mlrvaisali2k3 (1).ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with all code
- `Flight_Booking.csv`: Dataset {csv file}

## 🔍 Algorithms Used
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor

## 📈 Final Result

- ✅ **Random Forest** emerged as the best-performing model, achieving the highest R² score and the lowest error metrics, making it the most accurate for predicting flight prices.
- 🌳 **Decision Tree** performed reasonably well but showed signs of overfitting, especially with more complex patterns in the dataset.
- 📉 **Linear Regression**, while easy to interpret, failed to capture the nonlinear relationships and interactions in the data effectively.
- 📊 **Feature Importance** analysis revealed that:
  - **Airline**
  - **Source City**
  - **Days Left Before Departure**
  are the most influential factors in determining flight prices.
